# Climate Vulnerability Index Methodology

## Overview

The Climate Safe Cities Vulnerability Index combines climate risk indicators with adaptive capacity measures to create a comprehensive 0-1 vulnerability score.

## Mathematical Framework

### Vulnerability Index Formula
V = CR - AC + 0.5

Where:
- V = Vulnerability Index (0-1)
- CR = Climate Risk (0-1)
- AC = Adaptive Capacity (0-1)

### Climate Risk Components

#### Temperature Risk (TR)
- Heat wave frequency
- Extreme temperature events
- Temperature variability
- Warming trends

#### Precipitation Risk (PR)
- Flood risk indicators
- Drought frequency
- Precipitation variability
- Extreme precipitation events

**Climate Risk Calculation:**
CR = (TR + PR) / 2

### Adaptive Capacity Components

#### Economic Resilience (ER)
- GDP per capita (normalized)
- Economic diversity index
- Gender inclusion metrics

#### Social Resilience (SR)
- Inverse of social vulnerability
- Health indicators
- Educational attainment
- Infrastructure access

**Adaptive Capacity Calculation:**
AC = (ER + SR) / 2

## Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**: Multi-source API integration
2. **Quality Assurance**: Automated checks and validation
3. **Normalization**: 0-1 scaling for all indicators
4. **Index Calculation**: Weighted component aggregation
5. **Categorical Assignment**: Risk level classification

## Validation and Limitations

### Strengths
- Multi-dimensional assessment
- Standardized global methodology
- Reproducible workflow
- Open source transparency

### Limitations
- Data availability varies by country
- Temporal resolution constraints
- Urban heat island effects not captured in all cities
- Socioeconomic proxies for some regions
